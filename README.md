# Dynamic Traffic Management System  

## Overview  
This project leverages advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to revolutionize traffic management at intersections. By utilizing YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time vehicle detection and OpenCV for video processing, the system dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings to optimize vehicle flow, reduce congestion, and enhance urban mobility.  

## Key Features  
- **Real-Time Vehicle Detection**: Identifies and counts vehicles such as cars, buses, motorcycles, and trucks using the YOLOv5 model.  
- **Dynamic Signal Optimization**: Adjusts traffic signal timings based on real-time vehicle counts to minimize delays and congestion.  
- **Scalability**: Adaptable to various intersection layouts and traffic conditions.  
- **Visualization**: Provides live video feeds with bounding boxes and labels for detected vehicles.  

## Technologies Used  
- **YOLOv5**: State-of-the-art object detection model pretrained on the COCO dataset.  
- **OpenCV**: For video capture, processing, and visualization.  
- **PyTorch**: Backend framework for running the YOLOv5 model.  
- **Python**: Programming language for implementation and integration.  

## How It Works  
1. **Vehicle Detection**: YOLOv5 detects vehicles in each frame of a traffic video or live camera feed.  
2. **Filtering**: Filters detections to focus on relevant vehicle classes (e.g., cars, buses, trucks).  
3. **Signal Optimization**: Analyzes vehicle counts and dynamically adjusts traffic light timings to optimize flow.  
4. **Visualization**: Displays real-time video with bounding boxes and labels for detected vehicles.  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the application:  
   ```bash
   python killer.py
   ```  

## Usage  
- Replace the video file path in `killer.py` with your own traffic video or live camera feed.  
- Press **'q'** to exit the visualization window.  

## Example Output  
The system provides real-time bounding boxes and labels for vehicles detected in the video feed:

## Future Improvements  
- Integration with traffic signal hardware for real-world deployment.  
- Support for multi-lane and multi-intersection scenarios.  
- Advanced algorithms for predictive traffic flow analysis.
